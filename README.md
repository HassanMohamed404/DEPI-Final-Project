### **1. Introduction**
Our goal was to apply key data analytics techniques to turn transactional sales data into useful business insights. This included data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to answer specific business questions related to sales and profitability.

### **2. Data Collection and Cleaning**
- **Data Sources**: The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes customer orders, product categories, discounts, and sales reps.
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - **Missing Data**: Rows with missing values, particularly in critical fields (e.g., Sales Amount, Customer Name), were either imputed or removed.
  - **Date Formatting**: Dates were converted to proper formats for accurate analysis.
  - **Outlier Detection**: Outliers in sales and margin were reviewed to ensure data accuracy.

### **3. Data Analysis**
We focused on several key questions:
- **Sales Performance**: Examined total sales over time, identified peak sales periods, and explored product revenue generation.
- **Profitability**: Analyzed profit margins, the impact of discounts on profits, and product ROI.
- **Customer Analysis**: Investigated top customers and repeat purchase patterns.
- **Sales Rep Performance**: Measured performance by region and identified top-performing sales reps.
- **Product & Inventory Analysis**: Tracked sales trends by product and examined the impact of discounts.

### **4. Data Visualization**
Visualizations were created in Tableau, including:
- Line charts for sales trends
- Bar charts for top products, customers, and profitability metrics
- Scatter plots to analyze discounts and profitability
- Heatmaps for regional sales performance

### **5. Dashboard**
An interactive Tableau dashboard provides an overview of key metrics:
- **Sales Performance**: Total sales, profitability, and seasonal trends
- **Customer Segments**: High-value customers and loyalty patterns
- **Sales Rep Metrics**: Comparison of sales rep performance by region
- **Product Insights**: Top-performing products and inventory analysis

### **6. Key Insights**
- **Sales Peaks**: Significant sales spikes during holidays indicate seasonal demand.
- **High-Value Products**: Specific products like "canned goods" and "dried mushrooms" drive high revenue and profitability.
- **Customer Loyalty**: Core group of repeat customers can be targeted with loyalty programs.
- **Discount Strategies**: Discounts boost sales but may reduce profit margins, suggesting a need for optimized discount policies.

### **7. Conclusion**
The analysis provides valuable insights to help improve product focus, customer engagement, and profitability. By focusing on high-margin products, refining discount strategies, and targeting loyal customers, the business can increase revenue and optimize costs.
